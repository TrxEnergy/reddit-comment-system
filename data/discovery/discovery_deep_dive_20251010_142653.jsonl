Here is a link to the Certik audit: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu)\n\nAnyways back to the IRL efforts, we have over 20 community led initiatives from a street team(KenduSTREET) to a coffee business to a merch business and many others. Since these are community led so many will be waiting for higher levels to release their initiative since they will have more money to play with, the Kendu wave will only grow. IRL efforts are gonna be so important and decisive for retail investment because it shows **Proof of Humanity** that the community is actually real people with real investments. It also helps bridge crypto to the real world.\n\nKendu is self growing, many of these businesses like Kendu Video Games are making a treasury which will buy Kendu from a portion of the profits that they will make from the initiative, this is gonna keep Kendu's price stable and will help us push for the higher levels.\n\n[Kendu Pickleball in India](https://preview.redd.it/7vlxjxfd93uf1.jpg?width=1703&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138412e1ec01276e93ead2160efda001cd590d9f)\n\nKendu is arguably the best investment rn, at 15 million market cap there is so much room for growth compared to projects already in the hundreds of millions or even the billions.\n\nThis is just the start, remember people didn't make life changing money buying SHIB at 30 billion, to access a life of luxury you will have to buy the next Shib or the next Doge or the next Pepe, at the lower levels under 100 million mc...\n\nJust food for thought, do your research and have a think!\n\nWe Don't Gamble, We Work\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu/)", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T14:26:34.562433"}

Now is the time to get in though, up 70% already and things are just gonna heat up more and more and more, imo and this is NFA Kendu will not be below 100 million market cap by the end of this month. I couldn't tell you how high we will go because it's impossible and would just be a guess. Things move very very quickly in crypto and you are about to find out if you are brand new.

It’s part of the \"Raptr\" (or stylistically \"rAPTr\") family, the consensus redesign they’ve been rolling out in stages.\n\nThe goal is “one hop, one block.” Each network message triggers a new proposal. The next leader doesn’t wait for certification before moving ahead, so blocks flow continuously. Safety stays the same, but latency drops.\n\nBecause of this, Aptos runs around 100 milliseconds per block on mainnet today. And with Velociraptr, that’s expected to fall to about 60–65 milliseconds once it’s fully deployed. Baby Raptr, which went live earlier, already improved finality and resilience under load.\n\nIt's also notable that Aptos remains a general-purpose L1 with BFT consensus and parallel execution through Block STM. The speed comes from engineering, not centralization.\n\nI think devs will get a closer look at the new performance data during the \"Aptos Experience\" event that's supposed to take place in New York on October 15–16.

Network use is rising, fees just dropped with a 0.05 gwei setting, and regular burns plus some treasury buying help support price. Big plans for faster throughput are on the roadmap; main risk is if usage slows or rivals get better.\n\nBNB reached $1,111.90 on Friday, setting a new all-time high. The token is up 7.4% in 24 hours and 17.5% for the week. This is happening while the broader crypto market also gained, with total market cap rising 1.6% to $4.2 trillion.\n\nThe price movement aligns with what Standard Chartered predicted in May. They forecasted BNB would hit $1,275 in 2025, expecting it to move with Bitcoin and Ethereum gains. We're seeing that pattern play out.\n\nWhat's interesting is the on-chain data backing this up. Per DefiLlama at publication time, BNB Chain's total value locked increased about 2.5% in 24 hours to roughly $8.23 billion. BNB Chain reports record monthly active addresses, and monthly transactions are near cycle highs.\n\nThese aren't just price pumps. The network is actually being used more. When price and usage both increase together, that's typically more sustainable than price moving alone.\n\nSome corporates have announced BNB treasury allocations, and recurring auto-burns have reduced supply. After the previous all-time high in July, analysts noted that treasury activity alongside token burns contributed to price gains. That pattern appears to be continuing.\n\nThe timing coincides with technical upgrades. On Wednesday, BNB Chain validators adopted a new minimum gas price of 0.05 gwei. This makes transactions faster and cheaper for users. The BNB team is now pushing wallets and exchanges to adopt this standard to maintain the chain's competitiveness.\n\nLooking ahead, the roadmap shows aggressive scaling plans. The team wants to increase the block gas limit from 100 million to 1 billion to handle growing demand. By 2026, they're targeting 20,000 transactions per second with confirmation times under 150 milliseconds. They're also planning native privacy features and better developer tools.\n\nTwo major upgrades already happened this year. The Maxwell upgrade in June improved block speed and validator coordination. The Lorentz Hard Fork in April reduced block times and enhanced validator networking for applications that need low latency.\n\nThere was one security issue this week. The official BNB Chain account on X got compromised Wednesday and hackers posted phishing links. The price barely reacted, which suggests the market views it as a temporary security problem rather than a fundamental issue.\n\nThe combination of factors here is notable. You have institutional buying through treasuries, regular token burns reducing supply, network usage hitting records, technical upgrades making the chain faster and cheaper, and ambitious scaling plans for the future.\n\nStandard Chartered's $1,275 target doesn't look unreasonable if these trends continue. That would be about 15% higher from current levels. Whether it happens depends on Bitcoin and Ethereum maintaining their own momentum, since BNB tends to move with the broader market.\n\nThe risk is that network usage could plateau or decline if a competitor offers better performance or lower fees. The 2026 targets of 20,000 transactions per second would be competitive, but other chains are also upgrading. Solana already processes high throughput. Ethereum has its own scaling roadmap.\n\nFor now though, the data supports the price action. Higher usage, institutional accumulation, technical improvements, and positive market conditions are all pointing in the same direction.\n\nIf you're actively trading BNB or using BSC for DeFi, tracking cost basis across multiple buys becomes critical when prices move this much. Been using awaken since last tax season to automatically handle basis tracking and realized gains across BNB trades, gas fees paid in BNB, and BSC DeFi activity. The auto-burn events and corporate treasury flows create enough transaction complexity that manual tracking isn't realistic at any meaningful volume.", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T14:26:50.158282"}

Most likely, alt dominance will come back, and the best survivors are the ones that have a history of ratio consolidation.\n\nBNB is a great example of survival. Let’s look at the BNB/BTC ratio monthly chart.\n\n(You can paste it like this on TradingView: CRYPTO:BNBUSD/CRYPTO:BTCUSD)\n\nThe historical cycle:\n\n* During 2018 - 2021: The BNB/BTC ratio formed a double bottom on the monthly chart, consolidated for a while, and then, in the late cycle when alts pumped, it quickly retraced back to its ratio all time high and broke out.\n* This cycle: We can clearly see another double bottom on the ratio in 2024 and early 2025. Q4 is where altcoin season should play out. That gives BNB a high chance of retracing back to its 2022 ratio all time high of 1BNB = 0.0175 BTC.\n\nNow, do the math:\n\nDuring alt season, BTC can easily heat up to the risk zone of 70. According to the Dynamic Risk Range, BTC at 70 \\~ $145K.\n\nSo the possible price of BNB would be:\n\n$145K \\* 0.0175 = $2,537.5\n\nThat’s a modest 200% from the current price. Of course, it could go higher if BTC pushes further into the risk zone.\n\nAnd don’t forget ETH, the blue chip, king of alts. ETH leads alt season: it breaks ATH first, and it usually lasts until the very end of the cycle. In both 2018 and 2021 tops, BNB topped right when ETH was peaking, with ETH risk in the 90 range. It’s reasonable to use the ETH risk metric as ur navigator for altcoins.\n\nI love the survivors, they’ve stood the test of time. The market will always be volatile, but that’s the game.

I have used Telegram for many years without any issues, and out of nowhere, access to my account was completely restricted.\n\nI already contacted Telegram support multiple times, explaining the situation, but I received no response. I feel completely ignored, and I don’t understand what happened or why my account was blocked.\n\nI am reaching out to this community for support. I want to:\n\nUnderstand the reason behind the block.\n\nFind ways to regain access to my account safely.\n\nLearn from anyone who has faced a similar situation and succeeded in resolving it.\n\n\nThis block has left me stuck, and I may need to get a new SIM card, which is inconvenient and frustrating. I hope someone here can guide me, share advice, or help escalate this issue.\n\nAny help, suggestions, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T14:26:50.876509"}

Not quiet like clockwork, but close enough.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion based on what I learned, so take it with a heap of salt.\n\nIn **bold** is the direct answer.\n\n# Is the bull cycle over?\n\nWith Fed rate cuts just starting? That's highly doubtful.\n\nPlus there's a long list of things going right at the moment.\n\nFor a proper crash and a bubble to burst, you first need a proper bubble.\n\n**We're probably not that far from it, but this market still needs a little more bubble.** Remember, what they say about market irrationality.\n\n# When will the bull cycle end and crash?\n\nFed rates could potentially drag this out longer into early 2026, but don't expect that narrative to stay fresh for too long either.\n\nUltimately, the sooner we get some big rallies, FOMO, and mania (but milder than previous cycles because of tapering volatility), the closer we will be to a crash.\n\nIf this recent rally from $108K to $126K has another leg like that, we won't actually be too far from a proper bubble.\n\nBecause the market loves to create self-fulfilled prophecies, **I would set your clocks for a crash somewhere between mid-November to mid-January**. And clockwork is the one thing that has been somewhat reliable in this market.\n\nEven if everything is rosy at the beginning of 2026, the forces of this market are too strong for a bull market to be extended for too long.\n\n# How high Bitcoin will go?\n\nMake sure you don't look at Bitcoin's history linearly, and start looking at the diminishing returns and tapering down of its volatility. It's a curve.\n\nNow that we're deep in the bull market, the fog is beginning to lift.\n\nFor me the sweet spot of that peak is between **$129K-$149K**. If I had to go with an exact price: $136.9K.\n\nI hope I'm not underestimating FOMO here, and overplaying the \"tapering down\" narrative.\n\n$150K target seems too popular now.\n\n# What about alt season? That's never gonna happen right?\n\nHas no one else seen the glimpses and foreshadowing last November?\n\nIt was very revealing about the nature of the market and how it still behaves with alts. With just enough FOMO in the market, you get people panic buying alts.\n\nThe market has been a little more tamed since, with only one other little injection of FOMO and another alt rally during the summer.\n\nA lower mania phase at the end of Bitcoin's bullrun could spell a milder and shorter alt season.\n\nSo **this alt season could really be milder** with ETH staying under $6K, but other major alts getting maybe only 30%-100% rallies, and a few lucky ones maybe getting 2x-3x. This in a scenario where Bitcoin only hits $136.9K.\n\n**If we get some big BTC mania rally, then yes, there will be some big alt rallies.** Why? Because people are greedy.\n\n# What about the bear winter, is it gonna be as brutal as usual?\n\nBitcoin *should* see its mildest winter. With a maximum drop down by only 60%-70%.\n\nBut what about MSTR, ETFs, big institutions and governments?\n\nIf that stuff implodes, it could create some **shit show** at maybe a higher level than FTX and LUNA.", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T14:26:52.977993"}
