Here is a link to the Certik audit: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu)\n\nAnyways back to the IRL efforts, we have over 20 community led initiatives from a street team(KenduSTREET) to a coffee business to a merch business and many others. Since these are community led so many will be waiting for higher levels to release their initiative since they will have more money to play with, the Kendu wave will only grow. IRL efforts are gonna be so important and decisive for retail investment because it shows **Proof of Humanity** that the community is actually real people with real investments. It also helps bridge crypto to the real world.\n\nKendu is self growing, many of these businesses like Kendu Video Games are making a treasury which will buy Kendu from a portion of the profits that they will make from the initiative, this is gonna keep Kendu's price stable and will help us push for the higher levels.\n\n[Kendu Pickleball in India](https://preview.redd.it/7vlxjxfd93uf1.jpg?width=1703&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138412e1ec01276e93ead2160efda001cd590d9f)\n\nKendu is arguably the best investment rn, at 15 million market cap there is so much room for growth compared to projects already in the hundreds of millions or even the billions.\n\nThis is just the start, remember people didn't make life changing money buying SHIB at 30 billion, to access a life of luxury you will have to buy the next Shib or the next Doge or the next Pepe, at the lower levels under 100 million mc...\n\nJust food for thought, do your research and have a think!\n\nWe Don't Gamble, We Work\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu/)", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T15:47:06.644915"}

Now is the time to get in though, up 70% already and things are just gonna heat up more and more and more, imo and this is NFA Kendu will not be below 100 million market cap by the end of this month. I couldn't tell you how high we will go because it's impossible and would just be a guess. Things move very very quickly in crypto and you are about to find out if you are brand new.
