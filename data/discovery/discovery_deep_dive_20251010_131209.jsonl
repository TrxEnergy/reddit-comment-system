As for the meme itself, join the tg and see for yourself, it’s always a lot of fun.\n\n**Here are the key points:**\n\n* **Soft launch date:** will be announced on Saturday. During the soft launch, various features will be tested and the staking pool will open. → You’ll be able to stake your $GEOFF, and the best part is that you won’t have to unstake/restake for the official launch.\n* **At launch:** DegenMoon will focus 100% on Ethereum launches. Later, you’ll also be able to deploy on *two blockchains at once* (through Wormhole, more below about the Degen Zone).\n* **Staking:** You’ll be able to stake/unstake your $GEOFF anytime. Staking payouts will likely occur every \\~12 hours, but you’ll need to cover the ETH gas fees to claim them.\n* **Platform structure:** There will be the **main platform** (with two official launches per day) and the **Degen Zone**, where *anyone* can launch their own token. (just like Pumpfun or Fourmeme, but on Ethereum)\n* **Content &amp; community:** There will be streaming options and more interactive features. Most of the content will be moderated by AI.\n\nThose are the main takeaways. A lot more was discussed during the Space, as always, and surely will be in the next hundred.\n\nHonestly, you’re *not bullish enough* on $GEOFF, which is sitting at just a \\~$650K market cap right now.  \nSome people spread hate toward Geoff for various reasons, but soon you’ll realize this was an incredible opportunity to grab a massive bag at dirt-cheap prices. When it’s 30x from here, it’ll be much harder, and the staking yield will be way lower.\n\nIf you made it this far, do yourself a favor and buy some $GEOFF.\n\nHave a great day, my degen friends and fellow internet strangers.\n\nCheers  \nS. or M. or whatever.", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T13:11:27.073871"}
