As for the meme itself, join the tg and see for yourself, itâ€™s always a lot of fun.\n\n**Here are the key points:**\n\n* **Soft launch date:**Â will be announced on Saturday. During the soft launch, various features will be tested and the staking pool will open. â†’ Youâ€™ll be able to stake your $GEOFF, and the best part is that you wonâ€™t have to unstake/restake for the official launch.\n* **At launch:**Â DegenMoon will focus 100% on Ethereum launches. Later, youâ€™ll also be able to deploy onÂ *two blockchains at once*Â (through Wormhole, more below about the Degen Zone).\n* **Staking:**Â Youâ€™ll be able to stake/unstake your $GEOFF anytime. Staking payouts will likely occur every \\~12 hours, but youâ€™ll need to cover the ETH gas fees to claim them.\n* **Platform structure:**Â There will be theÂ **main platform**Â (with two official launches per day) and theÂ **Degen Zone**, whereÂ *anyone*Â can launch their own token. (just like Pumpfun or Fourmeme, but on Ethereum)\n* **Content &amp; community:**Â There will be streaming options and more interactive features. Most of the content will be moderated by AI.\n\nThose are the main takeaways. A lot more was discussed during the Space, as always, and surely will be in the next hundred.\n\nHonestly, youâ€™reÂ *not bullish enough*Â on $GEOFF, which is sitting at just a \\~$650K market cap right now.  \nSome people spread hate toward Geoff for various reasons, but soon youâ€™ll realize this was an incredible opportunity to grab a massive bag at dirt-cheap prices. When itâ€™s 30x from here, itâ€™ll be much harder, and the staking yield will be way lower.\n\nIf you made it this far, do yourself a favor and buy some $GEOFF.\n\nHave a great day, my degen friends and fellow internet strangers.\n\nCheers  \nS. or M. or whatever.", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T14:19:53.597934"}
