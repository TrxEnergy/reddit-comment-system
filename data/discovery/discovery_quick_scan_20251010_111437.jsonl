Not quiet like clockwork, but close enough.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion based on what I learned, so take it with a heap of salt.\n\nIn **bold** is the direct answer.\n\n# Is the bull cycle over?\n\nWith Fed rate cuts just starting? That's highly doubtful.\n\nPlus there's a long list of things going right at the moment.\n\nFor a proper crash and a bubble to burst, you first need a proper bubble.\n\n**We're probably not that far from it, but this market still needs a little more bubble.** Remember, what they say about market irrationality.\n\n# When will the bull cycle end and crash?\n\nFed rates could potentially drag this out longer into early 2026, but don't expect that narrative to stay fresh for too long either.\n\nUltimately, the sooner we get some big rallies, FOMO, and mania (but milder than previous cycles because of tapering volatility), the closer we will be to a crash.\n\nIf this recent rally from $108K to $126K has another leg like that, we won't actually be too far from a proper bubble.\n\nBecause the market loves to create self-fulfilled prophecies, **I would set your clocks for a crash somewhere between mid-November to mid-January**. And clockwork is the one thing that has been somewhat reliable in this market.\n\nEven if everything is rosy at the beginning of 2026, the forces of this market are too strong for a bull market to be extended for too long.\n\n# How high Bitcoin will go?\n\nMake sure you don't look at Bitcoin's history linearly, and start looking at the diminishing returns and tapering down of its volatility. It's a curve.\n\nNow that we're deep in the bull market, the fog is beginning to lift.\n\nFor me the sweet spot of that peak is between **$129K-$149K**. If I had to go with an exact price: $136.9K.\n\nI hope I'm not underestimating FOMO here, and overplaying the \"tapering down\" narrative.\n\n$150K target seems too popular now.\n\n# What about alt season? That's never gonna happen right?\n\nHas no one else seen the glimpses and foreshadowing last November?\n\nIt was very revealing about the nature of the market and how it still behaves with alts. With just enough FOMO in the market, you get people panic buying alts.\n\nThe market has been a little more tamed since, with only one other little injection of FOMO and another alt rally during the summer.\n\nA lower mania phase at the end of Bitcoin's bullrun could spell a milder and shorter alt season.\n\nSo **this alt season could really be milder** with ETH staying under $6K, but other major alts getting maybe only 30%-100% rallies, and a few lucky ones maybe getting 2x-3x. This in a scenario where Bitcoin only hits $136.9K.\n\n**If we get some big BTC mania rally, then yes, there will be some big alt rallies.** Why? Because people are greedy.\n\n# What about the bear winter, is it gonna be as brutal as usual?\n\nBitcoin *should* see its mildest winter. With a maximum drop down by only 60%-70%.\n\nBut what about MSTR, ETFs, big institutions and governments?\n\nIf that stuff implodes, it could create some **shit show** at maybe a higher level than FTX and LUNA.", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T11:14:37.469026"}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "is_self": true, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "discovered_at": "2025-10-10T11:14:37.469532"}

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn’t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this… this is painful to read..\n\n&gt; I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n&gt;Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n&gt;I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there’s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I’m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn’t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.
